This contains the patches to apply to the FG default shaders to obtain the CI shader.
This is to help updating the CI shader to follow FG changes.

make-patches.sh     creates said patches (takes reference FGData directory as argument)
apply-patches.sh    tries to apply said patches (takes FGData directory
                    used to obtain base shaders as argument)
