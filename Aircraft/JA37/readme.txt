* Flight manual:
    The flight manual is located under JA37/Doc/.
    There is also a shortcut to open in the simulator (JA 37 > Manual (opens in browser)).
* In simulator:
    Help > Aircraft Help    contains a summary of keybindings, and some additional information.
    Help > Checklists       contains historical checklists, including the startup procedures.
* Other:
    readme.ja37.txt  contains information about some advanced features of the JA 37 variant, not yet in the manual.
