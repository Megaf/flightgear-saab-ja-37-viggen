TODO for Flightgear Saab 37 Viggen
==================================


Features and improvements:
--------------------------
Aero: Adjust wave drag so max speed is M1.85 in ISA atmosphere and M2.03 in ISA-15.
Aero: Make recoil not assume that FDM rate is 120 Hz.
Aero: Tune speedbrake better.
Animation: Main attitude indicator lazy and jumps from 180 to -180.
Animation: Make jettison drop-tank actually fall down like other stores do.
Animation: Make rear boogie rotate at takeoff/landing rotation.
Animation: Review all indicator lights. For example the A/T light should blink by malfunctions or disengagements.
Animation: The bypass handle should not stay up for long.
Arms: Home on jam for missiles.
Arms: IR lock before launch should also check terrain occlusion.
Arms: Make the weapon mode dial operational: simulated mode, operational mode and reduced mode. In DAP, burst number for OP can be entered.
Arms: Pickle delay.
Arms: RB99 will be rail launched if sitting on a rail instead of always dropped.
Arms: When electrical power is off, the RB24J should not be able to cool.
CI: Memory button, for freezing image.
CI: Slew cursor.
Control: A/P does auto trim of roll.
Control: After exiting transonic the altitude hold should be recomputed. 
Control: Disable failure system from freezing surfaces (remove failure mode bug in 3.2- prevents)
Control: Limit elevator deflection due to servo-moment being smaller than moment of air-pressure. Page 19-20 in AK III.
Control: Make bigger factor in pitch normal comparison. (beware of oscillations)
Control: overhaul rudder trim.
DAP: Can enter K time (attack-time) for steerpoints. When that is done, it also becomes target steerpoint?
DAP: entering training floor should be tens of meters.
DAP: In pos/out showing info on next steerpoint, for steerpoints greater than 09, show hex. 11-15 = landing bases.
DAP: Input TACAN with REG/STR?
DAP: Minneslista JA37 has some DAP addresses. Make.
DAP: Output of not defined addresses should just be 0000?
DAP: Possible to enter date and revision number of LV/FF 001-189. But how?
DAP: Show sign of input at leftmost char always.
DAP: With L selector in LDL (auto-mode) L1 is asumed to be start base and L2 landing base. Hmm, need to know more..
Effect: Ambient occlusion map need to be baked again, many parts are too occluded.
Effect: Fix that with engine off, the wind can drive the fan which will produce smoke.
Effect: Make pilot G-loc/die due to G-forces.
Effect: Make tires burst if too high speed with parking brakes.
Elec: Double check that everything is on the right bus.
Elec: Flying above 1170Km/h with RAT might damage it.
Elec: Gun, radar and IR missiles was on seperate buses, fix.
Elec: Make logic for secondary DC bus G. It depends on BRAGG.
Engine: Model compressor surge/stall including bang sound.
Engine: Switch aug. type in engine?
GUI: Stop perf. monitor from running when dialog is off.
HUD/TI: FPI fin touches circle when estimated that will arrive at steerpoint in correct time.
HUD: Altitude scale should only be shown when engine is running due to it need AC power. (pitot-static needs AC?)
HUD: Make crossing out of hud when armament not ready to fire and trigger is pressed.
HUD: Slave-SI centers the landing guide. And hides the attitude ind. ILS needles. (only AJ variants)
MI: DLZ indicator.
MI: Implement radar sweep.
MI: Improve BIT test. [X1]
MI: Improve mark event [X3]
MI: Make TNF to stop/start inertial nav. (unsure about how this work and how the light react to it)
Model: A/P control in cockpit: A/T on throttle, A/P disengage on stick.
Model: AJ radar range control should be only 3 digits. (and be another place in the cockpit if should be accurate)
Model: Chair specific to Viggen.
Model: Ext. power truck more mil style textures.
Model: Fix z-fighting on HUD brightness-knob, datapanel knob, M71-rail and M90. (strange, might not be z-fighting, but sure looks like it)
Model: Flightstick specific to Viggen.
Model: Improve texturing of gears handle housing, it had some details on it.
Model: In JA the 2 gauges on right panel sat in a panel.
Model: JA version of radar control stick.
Model: Make liveries that is not 59, able to not have to use base texture.
Model: Make stick from throttle to gears handle housing. The throttle is too wide and the sidepanel is not aligned with X axis, that prevents it.
Model: Make the tooltips fail when gauges fail.
Model: Model speedbrakes.
Model: Proper floor in the cockpit.
Model: Put in more working instruments and controls.
Model: Put in not-working instruments and controls for immersion.
Model: Some control textures should be aligned so they can be better viewed from current pilot point of view.
Model: The 2 altimeters is wrong models.
Model: The frontpanel tap is misaligned.
Model: The JA has a small chronometer right of fuel gauge.
Model: The nosegear well, has gap between it and fuselage.
Model: The reserve generator RAT. (ram air turbine on left side just behind and under canard)
Model: Transponder panel more like the real, right panel.
Radar: Make ECM jamming.
Radar: Openradar has no roll and heading. Fix radar to handle that.

Sim: Complete hydraulic dependencies: Brakes.
Sim: Engine fire improvement: reduced thrust, stuck throttle.
Sim: Hydraulic drain.
Sim: I likely have confused alpha limit warning setting in DAP with setting the control limit itself. Fix.
Sim: Implement maximum speed reactions - Vne.
Sim: Improve terrain warning system.
Sim: Inertial navigation system.
Sim: Make AJ nav panel functional.
Sim: Make autopilot depend fully on instrument properties not true properties. (95% done)
Sim: Make droptank do collision detection. (use retractable)
Sim: Make replay show the guided missiles flying.
Sim: Make schedule for max climb rate with A/P at slow speed different when gears is down (or A/T AoA hold).
Sim: Make so that flares cannot be used after aircraft has crashed.
Sim: Make speed, roll, Nz and altitude limits on firing missiles.
Sim: Make verbose property to be used in all nasal scripts. (possible include in options)
Sim: Only send properties over MP when they change, will save up property space.
Sim: OPT FIX button pressed will make the current destination selected moved to right under the aircraft at push time. (datapanel rensa will set it back to what was programmed)
Sim: Pilot sometimes complains of lack of oxygen after relocation. [Probably fixed]
Sim: Pitot depend on AC power.
Sim: Reinit dont repair (sometimes).
Sim: Replace all generic setValue in nasal with specific types.
Sim: Review all replay signals.
Sim: Specific damage to gears in crash code, speed of impact and vertical speed separate. (terrain type?)
Sim: Startup with engines on, should have inertial navigation ready. (maybe altimeter should be preset too)
Sim: Stop auto-selecting when in tactical mode. (semi-done)
Sim: Strange slowdown of FPS after flying for a while and fighting with aim9.
Sim: To disengage A/P to mode 0 press switch on stick or pull fuse (will also disengage A/T).
Sound: Adjust the volume of the explosion of nearby missile, depending on distance.
Sound: I think I broke the AJ stall warn switch, fix.
Sound: Knobs for pylon and master-arm has no sound, fix.
Sound: Rework how missile buzz and growl works.
Sound: Should limit pre warnings be lower volume?
Sound: Sound from wind hitting the gears when extended.
Test: Engine starter should be hold in for 30 secs before quiting test, not instantly.
Test: Individual tests with test knob.
Test: Red and green lights should also lit up when pressing 'test indicator lights button'.
Test: Shut down also some indicators during testing.
Test: Testing from TI.
TI: Add rb-99 to SVY?
TI: Auto switching to next steerpoint happens when less than 3Km from current, and distance increasing.
TI: Be able to set steerorder to LV or FF points. (I cannot see in manual where that should be possible, so is on hold)
TI: Convert moving map to MapStructure. Slippy, airports, grid, traffic, FF, LV, routes, areas, runway, landingCircle/Line, missiles, bullseye, AAA.
TI: Has almost 100 getprop calls, convert to getValue.
TI: In menu SYST place cursor over steerpoint to see ETA (passagetid?). Most likely time planned to pass.
TI: In menu SYST, button 'LB'/'LS'. Steer order first to tangent point.
TI: In menu WEAP between the two middle edge buttons at bottom, its should say AK 120. For 120 ammo left.
TI: Make long route legs be curved.
TI: Make radar limit on SVY. (first radar should be changed to scan and beam be more vertically narrow)
TI: Make route info with overall ETA.
TI: Menu CONF-READDATA should show a static page.
TI: MPOL should only be able to hold 24 legs, and RPOL only 8. 48 + B0 + BDL in total.
TI: MSDA map should be north oriented (at least when MMAN is on).
TI: MSDA menu should only show polygon legs for the primary plan. (but still steerpoints for all)
TI: Navigation mode RR probably was intercept vector.
TI: Prioritize showing only 10 FF/LV points.
TI: RB99 telemetry should show IDLE, SCAN or LOCK when not fired.
TI: Run different through plans when drawing them on canvas. (what did I mean by this?)
TI: Select self and then show in lower right corner infobox on own flight.
TI: Some steerpoint can be forceringsbrytpunkt. Whatever that means.
TI: Steerpoint B0 is start pos. Its shown as current till take-off. When route is started being flown it is set at current position. Should not be saved with plans. Confusing, must know more.
TI: The runway approach line, for some reason do not get updated fast, so when turning sharply, it disconnects from approach circle.(or more likely opposite)
TI: Waypoint info should show ETA to next waypoint. And seperate infobox for full ETA.
TI: When cursor not active on TI, a shadow cursor is shown following the target cursor.
TI: When display is not showing image, backup menu is in effect, with hard-coded functions for the buttons.
TI: When flying RTB or MISS routes and small field in lower right corner should show deltatime, altitude and recommended mach. Whats delta time?
TI: When inertial navigation is not ready and GPS is off, don't show moving map?
Arms: Missiles have a time deficiency when time is slowed down more than 1/4. The JSB slowdown might not be accurate.









List of un-authentic systems, most scheduled for removal/change at some point
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automatic landing mode selection in AJ was really selected manual like in the JA.
Electronic map should not work, before inertial navigation has finished initializing, or GPS is on.
Aerobatic smoke, the real probably didn't have.
TI: Append or insert steerpoint should really be controlled from R1 switch, not be part of TI menu.
TI: OPT should really be a button on the flightstick, not be part of TI menu.
The real Viggen displays had 2 cursors; lock-cursor and TIM-cursor. The flightgear Viggen has combined it into 1 cursor.




Bugs:
--------------
GUI: The performance monitor can duplicate itself when selecting airport. [reproduced]
HUD: When autostarting is in progress, the HUD will switch off for a fraction of a second sometimes when loading stores. (due to stores mass moving the aircraft a bit and external power then gets disconnected.).
Model: All shader use of <use> does not work over MP.
Sim: Find out why cannon and sidewinder fire randomly after instant replay.
Sim: If HoT (/sim/multiplay/hot) is enabled, geo reports wrong ground elevation at a AI/MP aircraft location.
Sim: Sometimes when exploding, the sim freezes, typically at redout. [was bug in jsbsim, semi-fixed in 2016.1]
Sim: When Bombable 4.5 is installed redout and blackout might not work properly. [related to certain Bombable settings I think]
Sim: When relocating or pausing, autostart might fail. [reproduced]
Sim: {JazzTP} Replay did not replay explosion.
Sim: {Pinto} Has experienced that 2 engine directories were created under engines. That leads to error in performance monitor.
Sound: If at the end of non-looped replay view mode is fly-by-view, sounds will continue looping. [not reproduced]
