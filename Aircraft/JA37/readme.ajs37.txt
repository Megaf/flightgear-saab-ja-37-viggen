Main Mode Selector
==================
The AJS mode selector knob is located on the radar panel
(left panel, next to the throttle).
It allows to select the following main operation modes during the flight:

FK (TEST)       Not implemented (does the same as BER)
BER (STANDBY)   For startup and taxi. Displays are turned off.
NAV             Navigation mode. Includes a takeoff submode, activated on the ground.
ANF (COMBAT)
SPA (RECO)      Not implemented (does the same as NAV, without takeoff mode)
LANDING NAV     Instruments landing mode.
LANDING P/O (OPT)   Visual landing mode.

Landing 'Flip-Flop'
-------------------
For the LANDING NAV mode, the landing patterns can be modified by doing a
'flip-flop' as follows:
- Switch the mode selector to LND NAV -> LND P/O -> LND NAV
  to select a short approach pattern.
- Switch the mode selector to LND NAV -> NAV -> LND NAV
  to restart a full approach procedure.
